# google-homepage
First Project in TOP Web Dev 101

Details for this project can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css?ref=lnav

This is a replica of the Google homepage as practice for the Web Dev 101
section of The Odin Project. There will be no actual functionality to links,
menus, or forms, but every attempt will be made to replicate the look and feel
of the google homepage.

As of right now, the layout is 90% there. Some outstanding bugs include the header alignment, link hover behavior, and footer behavior when resizing the window.
